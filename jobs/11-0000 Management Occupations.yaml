explanation: Management occupations typically involve a high degree of group collaboration
  and communication, as they often require leading teams, making strategic decisions,
  and interacting with various stakeholders. This accounts for the high percentage
  in this category. Solo computer work, such as planning, budgeting, and reporting,
  also forms a significant part of their job, but not as much as group work. High

  in manual labor. The vulnerability to AI displacement is relatively low because

  and interpersonal communication. However, some aspects of their work, such as data
  analysis and administrative tasks, could be automated.
