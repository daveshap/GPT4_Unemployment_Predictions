explanation: Top executives' roles often involve a high degree of group collaboration
  and communication, such as meetings, strategic planning, and leadership, which is
  difficult to automate and accounts for 60% of their work. Solo computer work, such
  as email communication and document preparation, could be automated to some extent
  and makes up about 35% of their work. High dexterity physical contact is minimal
  in this role, estimated at 5%. The intrinsic technological vulnerability is relatively
  low at 20% as the strategic and leadership aspects of these roles are challenging
  to automate completely.
