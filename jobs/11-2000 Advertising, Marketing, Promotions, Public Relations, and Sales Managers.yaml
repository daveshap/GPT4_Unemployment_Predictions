explanation: The occupation of Advertising, Marketing, Promotions, Public Relations,
  and Sales Managers involves a significant amount of group collaboration and communication,
  which is difficult to automate. This includes tasks such as meetings, marketing
  strategies, coaching, and teaching. Solo computer work, such as data analysis and
  report writing, makes up a smaller portion of the job, but is more susceptible to
  automation. High dexterity physical contact is minimal in this occupation. Despite
  the potential for automation in some areas, the intrinsic need for human judgment,
  creativity, and interpersonal skills in this field suggests a relatively lower risk
  of job displacement due to AI.
