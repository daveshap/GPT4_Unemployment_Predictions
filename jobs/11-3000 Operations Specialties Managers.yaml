TOT_EMP: 2,322,010
dexterity: 0.05
explanation: Operations Specialties Managers often require a balance of solo computer
  work and group collaboration & communication. Their tasks often involve planning,
  directing, or coordinating the operations of public or private sector organizations.
  While AI can automate some of the solo computer work, such as data analysis and
  report generation, the high level of group collaboration & communication, such as
  team management, negotiation, and strategic decision making, is harder to automate.
  However, the vulnerability is relatively high as AI continues to improve in decision-making
  capabilities.
