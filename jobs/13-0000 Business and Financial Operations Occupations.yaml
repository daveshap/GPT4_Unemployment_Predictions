explanation: Business and Financial Operations Occupations typically involve a significant
  amount of solo computer work, such as data analysis, financial planning, and report
  writing, which are highly susceptible to automation. However, these occupations
  also require a fair amount of group collaboration and communication, such as meetings
  and presentations, which are more difficult to automate. The dexterity component
  is minimal, as these jobs do not typically require manual labor. The vulnerability
  to AI displacement is relatively high due to the significant portion of work that
  can be automated, but the need for human judgment and communication skills in these
  roles somewhat mitigates this risk.
