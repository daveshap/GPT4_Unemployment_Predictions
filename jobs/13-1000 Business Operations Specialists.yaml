TOT_EMP: 6,660,810
dexterity: 0.05
explanation: Business Operations Specialists often work in an office environment,
  with a significant portion of their work involving solo computer tasks such as data
  analysis, report generation, and project planning. This makes a large part of their
  job susceptible to automation. However, they also engage in a substantial amount
  of group collaboration and communication, such as meetings and presentations, which
  are less likely to be automated. The dexterity component is minimal, as their work
  does not typically involve manual labor. The vulnerability to AI displacement is
  estimated to be moderately high due to the significant portion of their work that
  could be automated, despite the human element in their group collaboration tasks.
