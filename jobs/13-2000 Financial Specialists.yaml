OCC_TITLE: Financial Specialists
TOT_EMP: 3,016,910
dexterity: 0.05
explanation: Financial Specialists primarily work with data analysis, financial modeling,
  and other tasks that can be done on a computer, making them highly susceptible to
  automation. While there is a significant portion of their work that involves group
  collaboration and communication, AI advancements in natural language processing
  and decision-making capabilities could potentially automate these tasks as well.
  However, the need for high dexterity physical contact is minimal in this occupation.
  The intrinsic technological vulnerability is high due to the nature of the work,
  which doesn't necessarily require human involvement. Therefore, there is a 70% estimated
  risk of job displacement due to AI and automation.
