explanation: Computer and Mathematical Occupations primarily involve solo computer
  work, which is highly susceptible to automation. The dexterity component is minimal,
  as these jobs do not require significant physical labor or manual dexterity. There
  is a moderate amount of group collaboration and communication involved, but this
  is not the primary component of the work. Given the nature of the work and the capabilities
  of AI, there is a high risk of job displacement in this field, estimated at 80%.
