explanation: The occupation code 15-1200 refers to Computer Occupations. These jobs
  typically involve a high degree of solo computer work, which is highly susceptible
  to automation. The dexterity component is relatively low as these jobs do not require
  much physical labor or manual dexterity. Group collaboration and communication is
  moderate as these jobs often require some level of interaction and collaboration
  with team members. The vulnerability to AI and automation is high due to the nature
  of the work, which involves a lot of tasks that can be automated such as coding,
  data analysis, and system administration.
