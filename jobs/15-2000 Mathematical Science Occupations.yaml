TOT_EMP: 326,400
dexterity: 0.05
explanation: Mathematical Science Occupations primarily involve solo computer work,
  such as data analysis, algorithm development, and mathematical modeling, which are
  highly susceptible to automation. However, there is also a significant portion of
  work that involves group collaboration and communication, such as presenting findings,
  collaborating on projects, and teaching. The dexterity component is minimal, as
  these occupations do not typically involve manual labor. The vulnerability to AI
  displacement is relatively high due to the significant portion of work that can
  be automated. However, the need for human judgment, creativity, and communication
  in these roles provides some level of job security.
