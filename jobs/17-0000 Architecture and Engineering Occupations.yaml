explanation: Architecture and Engineering Occupations require a significant amount
  of solo computer work, such as designing, modeling, and analyzing data, which makes
  up about 50% of the job activities. These tasks are highly susceptible to automation.
  However, these occupations also require a fair amount of group collaboration and
  communication, such as project meetings, client interactions, and team collaborations,
  which account for about 30% of the job activities. These tasks are less likely to
  be automated. A smaller portion of the job activities, about 20%, involves high
  dexterity physical contact, such as on-site inspections and manual adjustments,
  which are the hardest to automate. Given the nature of these occupations, the intrinsic
  technological vulnerability is estimated to be 40%, as there is a significant need
  for human judgment, creativity, and interaction, especially in the design and decision-making
  processes.
