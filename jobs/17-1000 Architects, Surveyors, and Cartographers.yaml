explanation: Architects, Surveyors, and Cartographers require a mix of dexterity,
  solo computer work, and group collaboration. Dexterity is needed for on-site work
  and model creation, which accounts for 20% of their work. Solo computer work, such
  as drafting and design, makes up about 50% of their work. Group collaboration, including
  client meetings and team coordination, accounts for the remaining 30%. The vulnerability
  to AI displacement is estimated at 40% due to the high reliance on human judgment,
  creativity, and client interaction, which are currently difficult to automate.
