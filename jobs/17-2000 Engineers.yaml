explanation: Engineers, while they do require some level of manual dexterity for tasks
  such as prototyping or hardware testing, spend a significant portion of their time
  working solo on a computer, designing, analyzing, and simulating. However, they
  also require a fair amount of group collaboration and communication, particularly
  when working on large projects. The intrinsic technological vulnerability is moderate
  as while many tasks can be automated, the need for human ingenuity, creativity,
  and problem-solving skills in engineering is still high.
