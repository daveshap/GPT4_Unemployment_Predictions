OCC_TITLE: Drafters, Engineering Technicians, and Mapping Technicians
TOT_EMP: 635,300
dexterity: 0.15
explanation: The occupation of Drafters, Engineering Technicians, and Mapping Technicians
  involves a significant amount of solo computer work, such as drafting designs and
  analyzing data, which makes it highly susceptible to automation. While there is
  some level of dexterity involved in certain tasks, such as operating equipment or
  conducting fieldwork, this is not the majority of the work. Group collaboration
  and communication is also a part of the job, but it is not the primary function.
  Given the high level of solo computer work and the relatively low need for human
  dexterity and face-to-face interaction, this occupation has a high vulnerability
  to displacement due to AI and automation.
