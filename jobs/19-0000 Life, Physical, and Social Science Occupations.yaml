explanation: Life, Physical, and Social Science Occupations often require a significant
  amount of solo computer work, such as data analysis and research, which could be
  automated. However, these occupations also require a fair amount of group collaboration
  and communication, such as presenting findings and collaborating on research, which
  is more difficult to automate. Additionally, some of these occupations require a
  degree of manual dexterity, such as conducting physical experiments or handling
  delicate samples. While there is a risk of job displacement due to AI, the need
  for human judgment, creativity, and communication in these fields reduces this risk
  somewhat.
