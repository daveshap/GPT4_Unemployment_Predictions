explanation: Life Scientists often require a certain level of manual dexterity for
  tasks such as lab experiments and field work, hence a 15% allocation. A significant
  portion of their work involves data analysis and report writing, which can be done
  solo on a computer, hence a 45% allocation. Collaboration is also key in this field
  for brainstorming, discussing findings and planning further research, hence a 40%
  allocation. The intrinsic technological vulnerability is estimated at 30% as while
  some tasks can be automated, the need for human judgement, creativity and ethical
  considerations in life sciences research is still high.
