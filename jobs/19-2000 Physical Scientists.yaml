dexterity: 0.15
explanation: Physical Scientists often require a degree of manual dexterity for lab
  work and fieldwork, but a significant portion of their work involves data analysis
  and computer modeling, which could be automated. However, their work also often
  involves collaboration and communication with other scientists, which is less susceptible
  to automation. The intrinsic technological vulnerability is moderate as some aspects
  of the job could be automated, but the need for human judgment and interpretation
  in scientific research is still high.
