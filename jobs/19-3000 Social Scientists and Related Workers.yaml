explanation: Social Scientists and Related Workers often require a high level of human
  interaction and judgment, making them less susceptible to automation. While some
  of their work can be done solo on a computer, much of it involves collaboration
  and communication with others. Their work also requires a level of dexterity, as
  they may need to handle various materials or equipment. However, there is a small
  risk of job displacement due to the rise of AI, as some data analysis and research
  tasks could potentially be automated.
