TOT_EMP: 133,100
dexterity: 0.2
explanation: Occupational Health and Safety Specialists and Technicians require a
  mix of physical dexterity, solo computer work, and group collaboration. Physical
  dexterity is needed for on-site inspections and handling safety equipment. Solo
  computer work is involved in analyzing data and preparing reports. Group collaboration
  is essential for conducting safety training and meetings. The intrinsic technological
  vulnerability is relatively low as the human judgment and interaction involved in
  ensuring workplace safety cannot be fully replaced by AI. However, some aspects
  of data analysis and report preparation could be automated, hence a vulnerability
  score of 0.3.
group: 0.4
solo: 0.4
vulnerability: 0.3
