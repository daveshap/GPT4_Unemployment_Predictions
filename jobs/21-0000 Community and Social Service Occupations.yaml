explanation: Community and Social Service Occupations involve a significant amount
  of human interaction, empathy, and understanding, which are difficult to automate.
  While some tasks such as data entry and report generation can be automated (25%),
  the majority of the work involves group collaboration and communication (60%). There
  is a small portion of the work that may require manual dexterity (15%), such as
  handling paperwork or setting up equipment for presentations or community events.
  The intrinsic technological vulnerability is low (10%) due to the high demand for
  human empathy, understanding, and interaction in these roles.
