explanation: Legal occupations often require a high degree of human judgement, decision-making,
  and face-to-face interactions, making them less susceptible to automation. However,
  some aspects of the work, such as research, document review, and drafting, can be
  done solo on a computer and are thus more vulnerable to automation. The dexterity
  component is relatively low as most legal work does not require manual labor. The
  overall vulnerability to displacement by AI is estimated to be moderate, as AI can
  potentially take over some tasks but not all.
