explanation: The occupation of Lawyers, Judges, and Related Workers involves a significant
  amount of group collaboration and communication, such as court proceedings, client
  meetings, and negotiation sessions, which are difficult to automate. Solo computer
  work, such as legal research and document drafting, could potentially be automated,
  but the complexity and nuance of legal language may pose a challenge for AI. The
  job requires minimal physical dexterity. Despite the potential for automation in
  some areas, the intrinsic need for human judgment, ethics, and the ability to understand
  and navigate complex human situations makes this occupation less vulnerable to displacement
  by AI.
