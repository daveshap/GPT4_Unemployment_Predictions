explanation: Legal Support Workers, such as paralegals and legal assistants, often
  perform a mix of solo computer work, group collaboration, and some tasks requiring
  manual dexterity. The majority of their work involves researching legal precedents,
  drafting documents, and organizing files, which can be done on a computer and thus
  are susceptible to automation. However, they also engage in significant group collaboration,
  such as meeting with clients, attorneys, and court personnel, which is less likely
  to be automated. Tasks requiring manual dexterity, such as handling physical files
  or documents, make up a smaller portion of their work. Given the nature of their
  work, there is a moderate risk of job displacement due to AI, as many of their tasks
  can be automated, but the need for human judgment and interaction in the legal field
  remains significant.
