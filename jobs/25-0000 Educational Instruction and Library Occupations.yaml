explanation: Educational Instruction and Library Occupations require a significant
  amount of group collaboration and communication, as teaching, coaching, and library
  assistance often involve direct human interaction. This makes up an estimated 60%
  of the work activities. Solo computer work, such as lesson planning, grading, and
  research, may account for about 25% of the work. High dexterity physical contact
  is less common in these occupations, but may still account for around 15% of the
  work, such as handling books in a library or demonstrating a task in a classroom.
  The intrinsic technological vulnerability is relatively low, at 20%, as the human
  element is crucial in education and library services. While certain tasks may be
  automated, the need for human interaction and judgement in these fields is likely
  to remain.
