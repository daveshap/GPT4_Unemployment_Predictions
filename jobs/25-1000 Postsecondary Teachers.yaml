dexterity: 0.05
explanation: Postsecondary teachers require a low level of dexterity as their work
  does not involve much physical labor. A significant portion of their work involves
  solo tasks such as research, grading, and lesson planning which can be done on a
  computer. However, a large part of their job involves group collaboration and communication,
  such as teaching, advising, and attending meetings. While AI can assist in some
  aspects of their job, the need for human interaction and judgment in teaching and
  advising students makes this occupation less vulnerable to displacement by AI.
