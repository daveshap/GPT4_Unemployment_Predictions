TOT_EMP: 4,177,640

explanation: The occupation of teaching, especially at the preschool, elementary,
  middle, secondary, and special education levels, involves a significant amount of
  group collaboration and communication. This includes face-to-face interactions with
  students, parents, and other educators, which is difficult to automate. While there
  is a portion of the job that involves solo computer work, such as lesson planning
  and grading, this is not the majority of the work. There is also a small amount
  of high dexterity physical contact involved, such as setting up classroom materials.
  The intrinsic technological vulnerability is low, as the human element is crucial
  in education, particularly in understanding and responding to individual student
  needs and in providing a nurturing learning environment.
