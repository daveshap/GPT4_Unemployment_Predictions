explanation: The occupation of Other Teachers and Instructors involves a significant
  amount of group collaboration and communication, as teaching inherently involves
  interaction with students. This makes up 60% of the job activities. Solo computer
  work, such as lesson planning and grading, makes up about 25% of the job. High dexterity
  physical contact is relatively low at 15%, as this could involve setting up classroom
  materials or demonstrating certain activities. The intrinsic technological vulnerability
  is estimated at 20%, as the human element in teaching is crucial, especially in
  terms of empathy, understanding, and adaptability to individual student needs. However,
  certain aspects like grading and lesson planning could be automated.
