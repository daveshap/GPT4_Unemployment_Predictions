dexterity: 0.15
explanation: Librarians, Curators, and Archivists require a moderate level of dexterity
  for tasks such as handling books and artifacts (15%). A significant portion of their
  work involves solo computer work, such as cataloging and research (45%). However,
  they also spend a considerable amount of time in group collaboration and communication,
  such as assisting patrons and conducting educational programs (40%). The intrinsic
  technological vulnerability is relatively low (30%) because these professionals
  provide a human touch in their services that cannot be fully replaced by AI, such
  as understanding specific patron needs and providing personalized assistance.
