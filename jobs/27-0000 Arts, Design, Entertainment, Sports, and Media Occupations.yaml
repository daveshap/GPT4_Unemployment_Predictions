explanation: Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports, and Media Occupations often require
  a high level of creativity, human interaction, and physical dexterity, which are
  difficult to automate. While some aspects of these jobs, such as editing or graphic
  design, can be done on a computer and are thus susceptible to automation, many other
  aspects, such as performing arts or sports, require physical presence and dexterity.
  Furthermore, these occupations often require a high level of group collaboration
  and communication, such as in brainstorming sessions or team sports. Therefore,
  while there is some risk of job displacement due to AI, it is relatively low compared
  to other occupations.
