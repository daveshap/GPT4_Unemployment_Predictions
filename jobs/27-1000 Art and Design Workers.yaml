OCC_TITLE: Art and Design Workers
TOT_EMP: 678,620
dexterity: 0.35
explanation: Art and Design Workers require a significant amount of manual dexterity
  for tasks such as sketching, painting, and sculpting, which is difficult to automate.
  They also spend a considerable amount of time working solo on a computer, using
  design software, which is susceptible to automation. However, they also engage in
  a fair amount of group collaboration and communication, such as client meetings
  and team brainstorming sessions, which is difficult to automate. Despite the technological
  advancements in AI, the creative and subjective nature of art and design work makes
  it less vulnerable to automation compared to other occupations. Therefore, the estimated
  risk of displacement due to no intrinsic need for humans is 40%.
