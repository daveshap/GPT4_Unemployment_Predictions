explanation: Entertainers and Performers, Sports and Related Workers require a high
  level of dexterity and physical coordination, making up 60% of their work activities.
  Solo computer work is minimal, at 10%, as their work is largely performance-based.
  Group collaboration and communication make up 30% of their work, as they often work
  in teams or groups. The vulnerability to AI displacement is relatively low at 20%,
  as the intrinsic human element is crucial in this field. The emotional connection,
  creativity, and physical presence that humans bring to entertainment and sports
  cannot be easily replicated by AI.
