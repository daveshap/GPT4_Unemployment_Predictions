OCC_TITLE: Media and Communication Workers
TOT_EMP: 630,340
dexterity: 0.15
explanation: Media and Communication Workers often require a mix of solo computer
  work, group collaboration, and some level of dexterity. The solo computer work,
  such as writing, editing, and digital design, is highly susceptible to automation.
  However, the group collaboration aspect, which includes brainstorming sessions,
  meetings, and presentations, is less likely to be automated. The dexterity component
  comes into play in tasks such as setting up equipment for recording or broadcasting.
  The intrinsic technological vulnerability is moderate as the creative and human
  aspect of this occupation is still crucial, despite the potential for automation
  in certain tasks.
