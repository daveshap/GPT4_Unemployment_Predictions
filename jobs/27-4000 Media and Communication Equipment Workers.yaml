TOT_EMP: 227,810
dexterity: 0.15
explanation: Media and Communication Equipment Workers often require a mix of solo
  computer work, group collaboration, and some level of dexterity. The solo computer
  work, which makes up about 45% of the job, is highly susceptible to automation.
  Group collaboration, which is about 40% of the job, is less likely to be automated
  due to the need for human interaction and decision-making. Dexterity is required
  for about 15% of the job, which is the hardest to automate. However, given the high
  percentage of computer work and the nature of the industry which is rapidly embracing
  AI and automation, the vulnerability of this occupation to displacement due to AI
  is estimated to be 60%.
