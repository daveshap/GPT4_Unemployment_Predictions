OCC_TITLE: Healthcare Diagnosing or Treating Practitioners
TOT_EMP: 5,965,270
dexterity: 0.45
explanation: Healthcare diagnosing or treating practitioners require a high level
  of manual dexterity (45%) for tasks such as surgery, physical examination, and administering
  treatments. They also spend a significant amount of time (30%) in group collaboration
  and communication, discussing patient care with other healthcare professionals and
  communicating with patients and their families. Solo computer work, such as updating
  patient records or researching medical literature, accounts for about 25% of their
  work. The intrinsic technological vulnerability is low (10%) because the human touch,
  empathy, and judgement are critical in healthcare, and it is unlikely that patients
  would accept being diagnosed or treated solely by AI or robots.
