TOT_EMP: 2,949,600
dexterity: 0.45
explanation: Health Technologists and Technicians require a significant amount of
  manual dexterity for tasks such as drawing blood, operating medical equipment, and
  performing other hands-on healthcare procedures. This accounts for the high dexterity
  score. They also spend a portion of their time on solo computer work, such as entering
  patient data into electronic health records. However, a significant part of their
  work also involves face-to-face interactions with patients, explaining procedures,
  and working with other healthcare professionals, hence the group collaboration score.
  The vulnerability score is relatively low because healthcare is a field that requires
  a high degree of human touch, empathy, and judgement, which are currently beyond
  the capabilities of AI and machines.
