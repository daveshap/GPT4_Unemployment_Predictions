explanation: The occupation code 29-9000 includes a variety of healthcare practitioners
  and technical occupations. These jobs often require a high level of manual dexterity
  (45%) for tasks such as administering treatments or operating medical equipment.
  A significant portion of the work (25%) can be done solo, such as record keeping
  or analyzing medical data, which could potentially be automated. However, a substantial
  part of the job (30%) involves group collaboration and communication, such as discussing
  patient care with other healthcare professionals or educating patients, which is
  less likely to be automated. Given the high demand for human interaction and judgment
  in healthcare, the intrinsic technological vulnerability is relatively low (15%).
  Despite advancements in AI, the complex and unpredictable nature of healthcare work
  makes it less susceptible to automation.
