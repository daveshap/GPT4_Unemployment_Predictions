explanation: Healthcare Support Occupations involve a high degree of physical contact
  and dexterity, such as assisting patients with mobility, providing basic care, and
  performing certain medical procedures. This accounts for the high dexterity score
  of 0.65. Solo computer work is relatively low at 0.15, as these roles often require
  direct patient interaction rather than isolated computer tasks. Group collaboration
  and communication is also significant at 0.20, due to the need for coordination
  with other healthcare professionals and communication with patients and their families.
  The vulnerability to AI displacement is low at 0.10, as the human touch and judgement
  are critical in healthcare support roles, and cannot be easily replaced by AI or
  machines.
