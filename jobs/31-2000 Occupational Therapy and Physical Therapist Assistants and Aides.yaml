OCC_TITLE: Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapist Assistants and Aides
TOT_EMP: 188,060
dexterity: 0.65
explanation: Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapist Assistants and Aides require
  a high level of manual dexterity and physical contact with patients (65%). This
  includes tasks such as assisting with exercises, providing therapeutic treatments,
  and helping patients with daily activities. These tasks are difficult to automate
  due to the need for human touch, empathy, and judgement. A smaller portion of their
  work involves solo computer work (15%), such as updating patient records or researching
  treatment plans. Group collaboration and communication (20%) is also a significant
  part of their work, as they often work in teams with other healthcare professionals
  and communicate directly with patients and their families. The intrinsic technological
  vulnerability is low (10%) because the nature of the work requires a high level
  of human interaction and care, which cannot be easily replaced by AI or machines.
