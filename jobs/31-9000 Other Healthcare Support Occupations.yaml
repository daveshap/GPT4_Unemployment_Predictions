explanation: Other Healthcare Support Occupations (31-9000) involve a significant
  amount of physical contact and dexterity, such as assisting patients with mobility,
  performing therapeutic procedures, and handling medical equipment, which is difficult
  to automate. Therefore, a high percentage (60%) of their work involves high dexterity
  physical contact. Solo computer work is minimal (10%) as these roles are not typically
  desk jobs. Group collaboration and communication is essential (30%) as they often
  work in teams and need to communicate effectively with patients and other healthcare
  professionals. The intrinsic technological vulnerability is relatively low (20%)
  because the human touch and interaction in healthcare support is crucial and cannot
  be fully replaced by AI or machines.
