explanation: Protective Service Occupations involve a significant amount of human
  interaction and decision-making, which is why the group collaboration and communication
  percentage is high. These jobs also require a certain level of physical dexterity,
  such as in situations of law enforcement or firefighting. Solo computer work is
  relatively low as these jobs are not typically desk jobs. The vulnerability to AI
  displacement is relatively low due to the high demand for human judgment, interaction,
  and physical presence in these roles.
