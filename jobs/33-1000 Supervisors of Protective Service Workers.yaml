OCC_TITLE: Supervisors of Protective Service Workers
TOT_EMP: 354,660
dexterity: 0.2
explanation: Supervisors of Protective Service Workers require a significant amount
  of group collaboration and communication, as they need to coordinate and manage
  teams, which is difficult to automate. They also require some level of physical
  dexterity for tasks such as equipment handling and potentially intervening in emergency
  situations. Solo computer work might include tasks such as scheduling, reporting,
  and other administrative tasks. The intrinsic technological vulnerability is relatively
  low as the nature of the job requires human judgement, decision-making, and physical
  presence.
