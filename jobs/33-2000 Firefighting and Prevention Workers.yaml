OCC_TITLE: Firefighting and Prevention Workers
TOT_EMP: 338,250
dexterity: 0.6
explanation: Firefighting and Prevention Workers require a high level of physical
  dexterity (60%) to perform tasks such as operating firefighting equipment, rescuing
  individuals, and physically combating fires. Solo computer work is minimal (10%)
  as it may only involve tasks such as report writing or equipment checks. Group collaboration
  and communication (30%) is essential in this role for tasks such as team-based firefighting,
  training, and community education. The intrinsic technological vulnerability is
  low (10%) as the physical and unpredictable nature of firefighting, as well as the
  human judgment required, makes it less likely to be fully automated.
