TOT_EMP: 1,161,080
dexterity: 0.35
explanation: Law enforcement work involves a significant amount of physical activity,
  including patrolling, apprehending suspects, and conducting searches, which accounts
  for the high dexterity score. Solo computer work, such as report writing and data
  entry, is also a part of the job but not as significant. The majority of the work
  involves group collaboration and communication, such as coordinating with other
  officers, interacting with the public, and testifying in court. The vulnerability
  score is relatively low because there is a strong intrinsic need for humans in law
  enforcement, both for their judgment in complex and unpredictable situations and
  for their role in community relations.
