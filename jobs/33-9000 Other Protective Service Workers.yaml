  This includes a wide range of jobs that require a high level of physical dexterity
  and coordination, such as security guards, lifeguards, and crossing guards. These
  jobs often require a significant amount of physical activity, hence the high dexterity
  score of 0.6. Solo computer work is minimal in these roles, hence the low score
  of 0.1. However, these roles often require interaction with the public or other
  team members, hence the group collaboration score of 0.3. The vulnerability score
  is relatively low at 0.2, as these roles often require a human presence for effective
  operation, and the judgement required in many of these roles is difficult to automate.
