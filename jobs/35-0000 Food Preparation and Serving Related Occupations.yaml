TOT_EMP: 12,514,620
dexterity: 0.65
explanation: Food Preparation and Serving Related Occupations require a high level
  of dexterity (65%) as they involve tasks such as cooking, cutting, and serving which
  require fine motor skills and coordination. Only a small portion of the work (5%)
  can be done solo on a computer, such as inventory management or scheduling. A significant
  portion of the work (30%) involves group collaboration and communication, such as
  interacting with customers and coordinating with other staff. The vulnerability
  to AI displacement is estimated at 40% due to the potential for automation in areas
  like order taking and food preparation, but the need for human interaction and dexterity
  in many tasks still remains.
