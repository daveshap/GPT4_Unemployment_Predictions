OCC_TITLE: Supervisors of Food Preparation and Serving Workers
TOT_EMP: 1,329,810
dexterity: 0.4
explanation: Supervisors of Food Preparation and Serving Workers require a high level
  of dexterity (40%) for tasks such as food preparation and handling equipment. Solo
  computer work is minimal (10%) as most tasks are hands-on or involve direct interaction
  with staff or customers. Group collaboration and communication is significant (50%)
  due to the need for coordinating with staff, training, and customer service. The
  vulnerability to AI displacement is relatively low (30%) because the role requires
  a high level of human interaction and judgment, which are difficult to automate.
