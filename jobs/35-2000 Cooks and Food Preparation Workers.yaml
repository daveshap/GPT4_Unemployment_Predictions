  (10%) as most tasks are hands-on. There is a moderate level of group collaboration
  (30%) in coordinating with other kitchen staff and understanding orders. The vulnerability
  to AI is relatively high (70%) as many cooking tasks could be automated, though
  the fine dexterity and taste-testing aspects of the job may still require human
  involvement.
