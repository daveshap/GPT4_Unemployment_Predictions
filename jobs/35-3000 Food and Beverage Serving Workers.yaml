explanation: Food and Beverage Serving Workers require a high level of dexterity (65%)
  for tasks such as preparing food, serving customers, and cleaning. Solo computer
  work is minimal (5%) as most tasks are hands-on and require human interaction. Group
  collaboration and communication is significant (30%) due to the need for coordination
  among staff and interaction with customers. The vulnerability to AI displacement
  is moderate (40%) as while some tasks can be automated, the human touch in service
  industries is often preferred by customers.
