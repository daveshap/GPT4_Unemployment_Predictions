explanation: The occupation of Other Food Preparation and Serving Related Workers
  involves a significant amount of manual labor, including food preparation and serving,
  which requires high dexterity and physical contact (65%). A small portion of the
  work may involve solo computer work such as inventory management or order processing
  (5%). A considerable part of the job involves group collaboration and communication,
  such as coordinating with kitchen staff and interacting with customers (30%). The
  intrinsic technological vulnerability is relatively high (60%) due to the potential
  for automation in food preparation and order processing, but the need for human
  interaction and manual dexterity in serving reduces the total risk.
