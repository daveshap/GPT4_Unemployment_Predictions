OCC_TITLE: Building and Grounds Cleaning and Maintenance Occupations
TOT_EMP: 4,316,350
dexterity: 0.7
explanation: Building and Grounds Cleaning and Maintenance Occupations require a high
  level of manual dexterity (70%) for tasks such as cleaning, repairing, and maintaining
  buildings and grounds. These tasks are difficult to automate due to their physical
  nature and the need for fine motor skills. Only a small portion of the work (10%)
  can be done solo on a computer, such as scheduling or inventory management. There
  is also a moderate need for group collaboration and communication (20%) for coordinating
  tasks and interacting with clients or supervisors. The vulnerability to automation
  is relatively high (60%) due to the potential for robotic cleaning and maintenance
  technologies, but is not complete due to the high dexterity requirements and human
  interaction aspects of the job.
