OCC_TITLE: Building Cleaning and Pest Control Workers
TOT_EMP: 3,026,520
dexterity: 0.7
explanation: Building Cleaning and Pest Control Workers require a high level of manual
  dexterity (70%) as they often need to handle cleaning tools and equipment, and perform
  tasks that require physical coordination. Only a small portion of their work involves
  solo computer work (10%), such as scheduling or logging tasks. They also need to
  communicate and collaborate with others (20%), for instance, to understand client
  requirements or coordinate with team members. However, the vulnerability of this
  occupation to AI is relatively high (60%) as many cleaning tasks could potentially
  be automated, although the lack of fine motor coordination in robots may limit this.
