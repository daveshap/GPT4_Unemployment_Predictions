OCC_TITLE: Grounds Maintenance Workers
TOT_EMP: 1,001,160
dexterity: 0.7
explanation: Grounds Maintenance Workers require a high level of dexterity (70%) for
  tasks such as mowing, trimming, planting, and general upkeep of landscapes. There
  is a small portion of solo computer work (10%) involved, possibly for planning and
  scheduling tasks. Group collaboration and communication (20%) is also a part of
  their job, as they often work in teams and need to communicate with clients. The
  vulnerability to AI displacement is estimated at 60% as some tasks could be automated,
  such as mowing and trimming, but others that require a high level of dexterity and
  human judgement may still need human involvement.
