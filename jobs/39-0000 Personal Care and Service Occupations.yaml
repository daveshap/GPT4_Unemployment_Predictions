explanation: Personal Care and Service Occupations require a high level of dexterity
  (60%) as they often involve tasks such as grooming, feeding, and assisting individuals
  with personal care. These tasks require a level of physical interaction and coordination
  that AI and robotics currently struggle with. Solo computer work is minimal (10%)
  as these jobs are not typically desk-based or computer-focused. Group collaboration
  and communication is significant (30%) as these roles often require interaction
  with clients, families, and other care providers. The vulnerability to AI displacement
  is low (10%) due to the high need for human interaction, empathy, and physical dexterity
  in these roles.
