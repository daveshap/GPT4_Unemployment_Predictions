OCC_TITLE: Supervisors of Personal Care and Service Workers
TOT_EMP: 205,440
dexterity: 0.2
explanation: Supervisors of Personal Care and Service Workers require a high level
  of group collaboration and communication, as they need to manage and coordinate
  the activities of personal care and service workers. This involves a lot of face-to-face
  interactions, meetings, and coaching, which is difficult to automate. They also
  perform some tasks that require manual dexterity and solo computer work, but these
  are not the main part of their job. The intrinsic technological vulnerability is
  low, as the nature of their work requires a human touch and judgment that cannot
  be easily replaced by AI or machines.
