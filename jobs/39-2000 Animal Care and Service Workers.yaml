explanation: Animal Care and Service Workers require a high level of dexterity (60%)
  for tasks such as grooming, feeding, and handling animals. Solo computer work is
  minimal (10%) as most tasks are hands-on. There is a moderate level of group collaboration
  and communication (30%) involved, especially in roles such as animal trainers. The
  intrinsic technological vulnerability is low (20%) as the care and handling of animals
  requires a human touch and emotional connection that AI and machines cannot replicate.
