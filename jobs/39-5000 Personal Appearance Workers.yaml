TOT_EMP: 521,210
dexterity: 0.7
explanation: Personal Appearance Workers, such as hairdressers, barbers, and cosmetologists,
  require a high level of manual dexterity and physical contact with clients, making
  up 70% of their work. This is difficult to automate due to the current limitations
  of robotic peripherals. They also spend about 10% of their time on solo computer
  work, such as scheduling appointments or managing client records, which could be
  automated. However, a significant part of their work (20%) involves face-to-face
  interactions with clients, which is difficult to automate. Given the high demand
  for human touch in this occupation, the risk of job displacement due to AI is relatively
  low at 10%.
