explanation: The occupation code 39-9000 refers to Other Personal Care and Service
  Workers. This category includes a wide range of jobs that require high dexterity
  and human interaction, such as personal care aides, childcare workers, and fitness
  trainers. These jobs require a high level of physical contact and coordination,
  which is why the dexterity value is set at 0.65. Solo computer work is minimal in
  these roles, hence the low value of 0.05. Group collaboration and communication
  are also significant in these roles, with a value of 0.3. Given the high demand
  for human interaction and physical contact in these roles, the vulnerability to
  AI displacement is relatively low, with a value of 0.1. This means that only about
  10% of these jobs are at risk of being displaced by AI and automation.
