explanation: Sales and related occupations often require a high level of human interaction,
  hence the high percentage in group collaboration and communication. While some tasks
  can be automated, such as data entry and analysis (solo computer work), the need
  for negotiation, persuasion, and relationship building in sales roles makes them
  less susceptible to automation. However, there is still a moderate risk of displacement
  due to advancements in AI customer service and sales technologies.
