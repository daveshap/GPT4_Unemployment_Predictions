dexterity: 0.1
explanation: Sales Representatives, Services (41-3000) require a low level of dexterity
  (10%) as their work does not involve much physical labor. A significant portion
  of their work (30%) can be done solo on a computer, such as managing customer databases
  and processing orders, which makes it susceptible to automation. However, a large
  part of their job (60%) involves group collaboration and communication, such as
  face-to-face meetings and negotiations with clients, which is difficult to automate.
  The intrinsic technological vulnerability is estimated at 40%, considering that
  while some tasks can be automated, the human touch in sales and customer service
  is still highly valued.
