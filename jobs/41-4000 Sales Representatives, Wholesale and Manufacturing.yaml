OCC_TITLE: Sales Representatives, Wholesale and Manufacturing
TOT_EMP: 1,564,230
dexterity: 0.1
explanation: Sales Representatives, Wholesale and Manufacturing, typically require
  a low level of physical dexterity (10%), as their work does not involve much manual
  labor. A significant portion of their work (30%) can be done solo on a computer,
  such as managing customer databases, processing orders, and preparing sales reports.
  However, a large part of their job (60%) involves group collaboration and communication,
  such as negotiating deals, presenting products to customers, and attending trade
  shows. Despite the high level of human interaction required, this occupation has
  a relatively high vulnerability to AI displacement (70%) due to the potential for
  automation of order processing, customer management, and even some aspects of sales
  negotiation and presentation.
