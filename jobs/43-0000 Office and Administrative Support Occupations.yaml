OCC_CODE: 43-0000
OCC_TITLE: Office and Administrative Support Occupations
TOT_EMP: 18,674,770
dexterity: 0.15
explanation: Office and Administrative Support Occupations typically involve a significant
  amount of solo computer work, such as data entry, scheduling, and document preparation,
  which are highly susceptible to automation. While there is some level of group collaboration
  and communication, it is not the primary function of these roles. The dexterity
  component is relatively low, as most tasks do not require high levels of manual
  dexterity or physical labor. Given the nature of these tasks and the capabilities
  of AI, there is a high risk of job displacement in this occupation code.
