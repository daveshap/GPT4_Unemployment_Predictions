OCC_TITLE: Supervisors of Office and Administrative Support Workers
TOT_EMP: 1,495,440
dexterity: 0.1
explanation: Supervisors of Office and Administrative Support Workers typically spend
  a significant portion of their time on solo computer work, such as planning, scheduling,
  and reporting, which could be automated. However, they also engage in a substantial
  amount of group collaboration and communication, such as team management, conflict
  resolution, and training, which are less susceptible to automation. The dexterity
  component is relatively low as their tasks do not require high physical dexterity.
  The vulnerability to AI displacement is estimated to be moderate to high due to
  the significant portion of tasks that could be automated, despite the human element
  required in their supervisory role.
