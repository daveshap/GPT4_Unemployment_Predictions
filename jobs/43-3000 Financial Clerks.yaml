TOT_EMP: 2,824,120
dexterity: 0.05
explanation: Financial Clerks primarily perform tasks that involve solo computer work
  such as data entry, record keeping, and financial transactions which are highly
  susceptible to automation. The dexterity component is minimal as the job does not
  require significant physical labor or fine motor skills. While there is some element
  of group collaboration and communication, it is not the primary component of the
  job. Given the nature of the tasks involved and the capabilities of AI, there is
  a high risk of job displacement in this field.
