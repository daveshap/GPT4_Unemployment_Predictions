OCC_TITLE: Information and Record Clerks
TOT_EMP: 5,615,960
dexterity: 0.1
explanation: Information and Record Clerks primarily perform tasks that involve organizing,
  recording, and storing information. These tasks are highly susceptible to automation
  as they often involve solo computer work. The dexterity required is minimal, as
  most tasks can be performed without the need for fine motor skills or kinetic intelligence.
  While there is some level of group collaboration and communication, it is not the
  primary function of the job. Given the nature of the tasks involved and the capabilities
  of AI, there is a high risk of job displacement in this field.
