OCC_TITLE: Material Recording, Scheduling, Dispatching, and Distributing Workers
TOT_EMP: 2,306,600
dexterity: 0.2
explanation: The occupation of Material Recording, Scheduling, Dispatching, and Distributing
  Workers involves tasks that are largely computer-based, such as scheduling, dispatching,
  and tracking shipments or deliveries. These tasks can be automated with AI, hence
  the high percentage of solo computer work (60%) and high vulnerability (80%). The
  job does require some level of dexterity for tasks such as handling materials, hence
  the 20% dexterity. Group collaboration and communication is not a major part of
  this job, but it is necessary for coordinating with other team members or departments,
  hence the 20% group work. Given the high potential for automation, there is a significant
  risk of job displacement in this field due to the rise of AI.
