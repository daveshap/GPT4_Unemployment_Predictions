TOT_EMP: 3,144,510
dexterity: 0.1
explanation: Secretaries and Administrative Assistants primarily perform tasks that
  can be done in front of a computer, such as data entry, scheduling, and correspondence,
  which makes up 70% of their work. They also engage in some group collaboration and
  communication, such as meetings and customer service, which accounts for 20% of
  their work. Only a small portion of their work, 10%, requires high dexterity physical
  contact, such as filing physical documents. Given the nature of their work, they
  are highly susceptible to automation, with an estimated 80% risk of job displacement
  due to no intrinsic need for humans.
