TOT_EMP: 3,235,430
dexterity: 0.15
explanation: The occupation of Other Office and Administrative Support Workers involves
  a significant amount of solo computer work, which is highly susceptible to automation.
  Tasks such as data entry, scheduling, and record keeping can be easily automated
  with AI capabilities. There is a smaller portion of the job that requires high dexterity
  physical contact, such as handling physical files or operating office machinery,
  and a moderate amount of group collaboration and communication. However, given the
  high proportion of tasks that can be automated, there is a high risk of job displacement
  due to no intrinsic need for humans in many of these roles.
