TOT_EMP: 461,750
dexterity: 0.65
explanation: Farming, Fishing, and Forestry Occupations require a significant amount
  of manual labor and coordination, hence the high dexterity score. However, with
  the rise of automated farming equipment and AI-driven decision-making tools, a large
  portion of these tasks could be automated, leading to a high vulnerability score.
  Solo computer work is relatively low as these occupations are not typically desk-based.
  Group collaboration and communication are moderately present in these occupations,
  but not as prevalent as physical labor.
