OCC_TITLE: Supervisors of Farming, Fishing, and Forestry Workers
TOT_EMP: 27,670
dexterity: 0.35
explanation: Supervisors of Farming, Fishing, and Forestry Workers require a significant
  amount of physical dexterity (35%) for tasks such as inspecting crops, animals,
  and equipment, as well as potentially operating machinery. Solo computer work is
  less prevalent (15%), as much of the work is done in the field. However, a large
  portion of the job involves group collaboration and communication (50%), as supervisors
  must coordinate with workers, provide instructions, and ensure safety protocols
  are followed. The vulnerability to AI displacement is relatively high (60%) due
  to the potential for automation in areas such as crop inspection and equipment operation.
  However, the need for human judgment in managing workers and responding to unexpected
  situations provides some level of job security.
