TOT_EMP: 390,500
dexterity: 0.7
explanation: Agricultural workers often engage in high dexterity physical work such
  as planting, cultivating, and harvesting crops, and tending to livestock. These
  tasks require a significant amount of manual labor and coordination, hence the high
  dexterity score. However, with the advent of AI and automation, many of these tasks
  can be mechanized, leading to a high vulnerability score. Solo computer work is
  minimal in this occupation, as most tasks are performed outdoors and not in front
  of a computer. Group collaboration and communication are also part of the job, but
  not as significant as the physical labor aspect. Therefore, the risk of job displacement
  due to AI and automation is quite high for agricultural workers.
