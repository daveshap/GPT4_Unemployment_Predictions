OCC_TITLE: Forest, Conservation, and Logging Workers
TOT_EMP: 42,830
dexterity: 0.7
explanation: Forest, Conservation, and Logging Workers perform a significant amount
  of physical labor that requires high dexterity, hence the high dexterity score of
  0.7. Solo computer work is minimal in this occupation, hence the low score of 0.1.
  There is some level of group collaboration and communication involved, especially
  in planning and coordinating tasks, hence the score of 0.2. The vulnerability score
  is relatively high at 0.6, as while the physical nature of the work may protect
  some jobs from automation, advancements in AI and machinery could potentially automate
  tasks such as tree cutting and logging. However, the conservation aspect of the
  job, which requires human judgment and decision-making, may be less susceptible
  to automation.
