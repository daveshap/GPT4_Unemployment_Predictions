OCC_TITLE: Construction and Extraction Occupations
TOT_EMP: 6,075,520
dexterity: 0.7
explanation: Construction and extraction occupations require a high level of manual
  dexterity (70%) as they involve physical labor and the operation of heavy machinery.
  Solo computer work is minimal (10%) as these jobs are not typically desk-based.
  There is a moderate level of group collaboration and communication (20%) as these
  jobs often involve teamwork and coordination. The vulnerability to AI displacement
  is relatively high (60%) due to the potential for automation in operating machinery
  and planning construction projects, although the need for physical labor and human
  judgment in unpredictable environments reduces this risk somewhat.
