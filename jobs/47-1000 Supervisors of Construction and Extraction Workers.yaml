OCC_TITLE: Supervisors of Construction and Extraction Workers
TOT_EMP: 720,900
dexterity: 0.35
explanation: Supervisors of Construction and Extraction Workers require a high level
  of group collaboration and communication (50%) as they need to coordinate with various
  teams, manage workers, and ensure safety protocols. They also require a significant
  amount of dexterity (35%) for on-site inspections and sometimes manual work. Solo
  computer work is relatively less (15%) as it might involve planning, scheduling,
  and reporting. The vulnerability to AI is moderate (40%) as while AI can assist
  in planning and scheduling tasks, the need for human judgment in managing people
  and ensuring safety on construction sites is still crucial.
