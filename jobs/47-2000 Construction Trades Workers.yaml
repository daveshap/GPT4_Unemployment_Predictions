OCC_TITLE: Construction Trades Workers
TOT_EMP: 4,509,820
dexterity: 0.7
explanation: Construction Trades Workers require a high level of manual dexterity
  (70%) for tasks such as operating tools and machinery, and performing precise manual
  labor. Solo computer work is minimal (10%) as most tasks are hands-on and require
  physical presence. Group collaboration and communication (20%) is also a significant
  part of the job, as workers often need to coordinate with others on site. The vulnerability
  to AI displacement is estimated at 40%. While some tasks could be automated, the
  need for human judgment, physical presence, and fine motor skills in many tasks
  reduces the overall risk of displacement.
