explanation: The occupation code 47-4000 refers to Other Construction and Related
  Workers. This job category involves a significant amount of manual labor and coordination,
  hence a high dexterity score of 0.7. There is minimal solo computer work involved,
  estimated at 0.1. Group collaboration and communication are essential in this field,
  especially for safety and coordination of tasks, hence a score of 0.2. The vulnerability
  to AI displacement is relatively high at 0.6, as some tasks could be automated,
  such as operating machinery or repetitive tasks. However, the need for human judgment,
  especially in unpredictable construction environments, and the high dexterity tasks
  involved, reduce the total displacement risk.
