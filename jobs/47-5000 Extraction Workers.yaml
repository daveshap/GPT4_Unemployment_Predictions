TOT_EMP: 195,750
dexterity: 0.65
explanation: Extraction workers, such as miners, oil drillers, and quarry workers,
  often perform tasks that require a high degree of manual dexterity and physical
  labor, making up 65% of their work. However, with the advent of AI and robotics,
  many of these tasks could potentially be automated, especially those that are repetitive
  or dangerous. Solo computer work, such as operating machinery or monitoring systems,
  accounts for 15% of their work, which is highly susceptible to automation. Group
  collaboration and communication make up 20% of their work, which is less likely
  to be automated due to the need for human judgment and decision-making. Given the
  nature of their work and the potential for automation, extraction workers have a
  high vulnerability to job displacement due to AI, estimated at 80%.
