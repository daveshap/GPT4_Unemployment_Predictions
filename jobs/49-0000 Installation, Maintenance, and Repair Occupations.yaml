dexterity: 0.65
explanation: Installation, Maintenance, and Repair Occupations require a high level
  of manual dexterity (65%) as they often involve physical labor and precise manual
  tasks. While some tasks may be performed individually and involve computer work
  (15%), a significant portion of the work also involves collaboration and communication
  with others (20%). Given the nature of the work, there is a moderate to high risk
  of job displacement due to AI and automation (60%). However, the need for human
  intervention in complex repair and maintenance tasks, as well as the need for human
  judgment in diagnosing issues, may still preserve a significant portion of jobs
  in this category.
