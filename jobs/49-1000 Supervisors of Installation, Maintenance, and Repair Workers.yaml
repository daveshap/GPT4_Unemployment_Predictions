dexterity: 0.35
explanation: Supervisors of Installation, Maintenance, and Repair Workers often require
  a high level of dexterity for overseeing and sometimes participating in physical
  tasks, which accounts for 35% of their work. About 25% of their work involves solo
  computer tasks such as scheduling, reporting, and other administrative tasks that
  could be automated. A significant portion of their work, 40%, involves group collaboration
  and communication, which is harder to automate. However, given the nature of their
  work, there is a 60% vulnerability to job displacement due to AI and automation,
  as many of their supervisory tasks could potentially be automated or streamlined.
