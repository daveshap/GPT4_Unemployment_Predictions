OCC_TITLE: Electrical and Electronic Equipment Mechanics, Installers, and Repairers
TOT_EMP: 496,220
dexterity: 0.6
explanation: The occupation of Electrical and Electronic Equipment Mechanics, Installers,
  and Repairers requires a high level of manual dexterity (60%) for tasks such as
  installation, repair, and maintenance of electronic equipment. While some tasks
  can be performed solo on a computer (20%), a significant portion of the work also
  involves collaboration and communication with other team members or clients (20%).
  Given the nature of the work, there is a high risk (70%) of job displacement due
  to the rise of AI and automation, especially for tasks that involve routine maintenance
  and diagnostics which can be automated. However, the need for human intervention
  will still be necessary for complex repairs and installations that require high
  dexterity and problem-solving skills.
