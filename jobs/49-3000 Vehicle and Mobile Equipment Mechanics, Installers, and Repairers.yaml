OCC_TITLE: Vehicle and Mobile Equipment Mechanics, Installers, and Repairers
TOT_EMP: 1,645,580
dexterity: 0.65
explanation: Vehicle and Mobile Equipment Mechanics, Installers, and Repairers require
  a high level of manual dexterity (65%) for tasks such as repairing, installing,
  and maintaining vehicles and equipment. While some tasks can be automated, the need
  for fine motor skills and physical inspection makes complete automation challenging.
  Solo computer work is estimated at 15%, as these professionals often need to use
  diagnostic software and other computerized tools. Group collaboration and communication
  is estimated at 20%, as these professionals often work in teams and need to communicate
  with clients. The vulnerability to AI displacement is estimated at 70% due to the
  increasing automation of diagnostic and repair tasks, although the need for physical
  dexterity and human judgment in complex repairs mitigates this risk.
