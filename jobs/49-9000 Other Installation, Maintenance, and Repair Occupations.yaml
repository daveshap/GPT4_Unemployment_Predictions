TOT_EMP: 3,122,550
dexterity: 0.65
explanation: The occupation code 49-9000 includes jobs that require a high level of
  manual dexterity and physical contact, such as installation, maintenance, and repair
  tasks. These tasks often involve handling tools and equipment, which is why a high
  percentage (65%) is assigned to this category. Solo computer work is relatively
  low (15%) as these jobs are not typically desk jobs. Group collaboration and communication
  (20%) is necessary for coordinating tasks and troubleshooting issues. The vulnerability
  to AI displacement is relatively high (70%) because while AI may not be able to
  perform all the physical tasks, it can automate diagnostic and some repair tasks,
  reducing the need for human labor.
