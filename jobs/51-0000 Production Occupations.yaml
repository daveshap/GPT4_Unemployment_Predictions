explanation: Production occupations often involve a high degree of manual dexterity
  and physical labor, hence the high dexterity score. However, with the rise of AI
  and automation, many of these tasks can be automated, leading to a high vulnerability
  score. Solo computer work and group collaboration are less common in these occupations,
  but they do exist, especially in roles that involve quality control, planning, and
  coordination.
