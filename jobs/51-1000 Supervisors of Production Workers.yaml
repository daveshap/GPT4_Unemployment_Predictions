OCC_TITLE: Supervisors of Production Workers
TOT_EMP: 659,930
dexterity: 0.3
explanation: Supervisors of Production Workers require a significant amount of group
  collaboration and communication (50%) as they need to manage teams, coordinate tasks,
  and ensure safety regulations are followed. They also require a fair amount of dexterity
  (30%) as they often need to demonstrate tasks, operate machinery, or step in to
  assist with production. Solo computer work (20%) might involve scheduling, reporting,
  and other administrative tasks. The vulnerability to AI displacement is estimated
  at 60% as while AI can take over administrative tasks and some aspects of machinery
  operation, the human element in team management and on-the-spot decision making
  is still crucial.
