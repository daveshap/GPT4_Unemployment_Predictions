OCC_TITLE: Assemblers and Fabricators
TOT_EMP: 1,903,910
dexterity: 0.65
explanation: Assemblers and Fabricators primarily engage in high dexterity physical
  work, which is difficult to automate. However, given the repetitive nature of the
  tasks and the limited need for fine motor skills, a significant portion of these
  jobs could be automated. Solo computer work and group collaboration are less common
  in this occupation, but they do exist. The high vulnerability score reflects the
  fact that there is no intrinsic need for humans in this role, as machines can potentially
  perform the assembly and fabrication tasks.
