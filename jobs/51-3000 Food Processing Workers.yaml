explanation: Food Processing Workers require a high level of manual dexterity (70%)
  for tasks such as cutting, sorting, and packaging food items. There is a small amount
  of solo computer work (10%), such as operating machinery or inputting data. Group
  collaboration and communication (20%) is necessary for coordinating tasks and ensuring
  safety standards. However, the vulnerability to AI displacement is high (80%) as
  many of the tasks performed by these workers can be automated, and there is no intrinsic
  need for human involvement in the majority of the processes.
