TOT_EMP: 1,644,250
dexterity: 0.65
explanation: Metal and Plastic Workers often require a high level of manual dexterity
  and coordination to perform their tasks, which makes up about 65% of their work.
  However, with the rise of automated machinery and AI, these tasks could potentially
  be automated. Solo computer work, such as operating computer-controlled machines
  or entering data, makes up about 15% of their work. Group collaboration and communication,
  such as coordinating with other workers or discussing plans, makes up about 20%
  of their work. Given the nature of their work and the capabilities of AI, there
  is a high risk of job displacement, estimated at 80%. This is due to the fact that
  many of their tasks do not intrinsically require human involvement and can be performed
  by machines or AI.
