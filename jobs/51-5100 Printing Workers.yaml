TOT_EMP: 214,280
dexterity: 0.6
explanation: Printing workers are involved in various tasks that require high dexterity,
  such as operating printing machines and performing adjustments to ensure quality.
  This accounts for 60% of their work. However, with the advancement of AI, these
  tasks can be automated to a large extent, hence the high vulnerability score of
  0.8. About 20% of their work involves solo computer work, which is highly susceptible
  to automation. The remaining 20% involves group collaboration and communication,
  which is less likely to be automated. Overall, the job displacement risk for printing
  workers due to the rise of AI is quite high.
