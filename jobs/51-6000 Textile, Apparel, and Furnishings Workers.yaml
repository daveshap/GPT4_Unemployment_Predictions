explanation: Textile, Apparel, and Furnishings Workers often require a high level
  of manual dexterity (70%) for tasks such as sewing, cutting, and assembling. However,
  these tasks are becoming increasingly automated, leading to a high vulnerability
  score (80%). Solo computer work is minimal (10%) as most tasks are hands-on. Group
  collaboration and communication (20%) may involve coordination with other workers
  or supervisors, but this is not the primary component of the job.
