explanation: Woodworkers require a high level of manual dexterity (70%) for tasks
  such as cutting, shaping, and sanding wood. There is a small portion of their work
  that involves solo computer work (10%), such as designing or planning projects.
  They also need to collaborate and communicate with others (20%), for instance, when
  working on larger projects or when dealing with clients. However, with the rise
  of AI and automation, there is a significant risk (60%) of job displacement. This
  is because many of the tasks performed by woodworkers can be automated, such as
  cutting and shaping wood. However, there will still be a demand for human woodworkers
  for tasks that require a high level of craftsmanship or for custom projects.
