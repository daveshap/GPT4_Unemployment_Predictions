TOT_EMP: 276,970
dexterity: 0.45
explanation: Plant and System Operators require a moderate level of dexterity for
  operating machinery and equipment (45%). A significant portion of their work involves
  solo computer work, such as monitoring systems and adjusting controls (35%). They
  also need to collaborate and communicate with other team members, but this is a
  smaller portion of their work (20%). Given the nature of their work and the capabilities
  of AI, there is a high risk of job displacement (80%) as many of their tasks can
  be automated and do not intrinsically require human involvement.
