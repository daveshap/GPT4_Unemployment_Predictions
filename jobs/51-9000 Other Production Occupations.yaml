explanation: The occupation code 51-9000, Other Production Occupations, primarily
  involves tasks that require high dexterity and physical contact, such as operating
  machinery or assembling products. This accounts for 65% of the work activities.
  About 15% of the work can be done solo on a computer, such as monitoring production
  processes or entering data. Around 20% of the work involves group collaboration
  and communication, such as coordinating with other team members or discussing production
  plans. However, given the nature of production work and the advancements in automation
  and AI, this occupation has a high vulnerability to job displacement. It is estimated
  that 85% of these jobs could potentially be automated, as there is no intrinsic
  need for humans in most of the tasks involved in production.
