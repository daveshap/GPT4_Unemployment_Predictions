dexterity: 0.65
explanation: Transportation and Material Moving Occupations often require a high level
  of dexterity, as they involve operating vehicles or moving heavy objects. However,
  with the rise of AI, many of these tasks could be automated, especially those that
  involve repetitive or predictable movements. Solo computer work is relatively low,
  as these jobs often require physical presence rather than remote work. Group collaboration
  and communication is also a significant part of these jobs, but it's not the majority.
  The vulnerability of these jobs to AI is quite high, as many of the tasks they perform
  could be automated with the right technology.
