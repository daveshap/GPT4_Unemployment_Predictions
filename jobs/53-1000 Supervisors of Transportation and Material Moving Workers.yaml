OCC_TITLE: Supervisors of Transportation and Material Moving Workers
TOT_EMP: 599,710
dexterity: 0.25
explanation: Supervisors of Transportation and Material Moving Workers often require
  a mix of physical dexterity, solo computer work, and group collaboration. Physical
  dexterity is needed for overseeing and sometimes participating in the transportation
  and moving process. Solo computer work is required for tasks such as scheduling,
  tracking, and reporting. Group collaboration is crucial for coordinating teams,
  communicating with other departments, and resolving issues. However, with the rise
  of AI, many of these tasks can be automated. AI can handle scheduling, tracking,
  and reporting tasks, reducing the need for human involvement. Furthermore, AI can
  also assist in coordinating teams and communicating with other departments. Therefore,
  this occupation has a moderate to high vulnerability to job displacement due to
  AI.
