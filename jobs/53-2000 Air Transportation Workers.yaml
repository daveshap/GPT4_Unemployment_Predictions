OCC_TITLE: Air Transportation Workers
TOT_EMP: 282,820
dexterity: 0.6
explanation: Air Transportation Workers, such as pilots and flight attendants, require
  a high level of dexterity and coordination to perform their tasks, hence a 60% allocation.
  Solo computer work, such as flight planning and navigation, accounts for 20% of
  their tasks. Group collaboration and communication, such as coordinating with ground
  crew and communicating with passengers, also accounts for 20% of their tasks. However,
  with the rise of AI, there is a high risk of job displacement, especially for pilots,
  as AI can potentially take over navigation and flight control tasks. Therefore,
  a vulnerability score of 70% is assigned.
group: 0.2
solo: 0.2
vulnerability: 0.7
