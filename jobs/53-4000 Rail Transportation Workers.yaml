explanation: Rail Transportation Workers require a high level of dexterity for tasks
  such as operating rail vehicles, performing maintenance, and handling cargo. However,
  these tasks could potentially be automated with advancements in AI and robotics.
  Solo computer work and group collaboration make up a smaller portion of their work,
  but these could also be susceptible to automation. The vulnerability of this occupation
  is high due to the potential for automation of rail vehicles and the lack of intrinsic
  need for human operators.
