explanation: Water Transportation Workers require a high level of dexterity for tasks
  such as operating and maintaining equipment, which is difficult to automate. However,
  some aspects of their work, such as navigation, could potentially be automated.
  Group collaboration is also important in this field, particularly in emergency situations.
  The vulnerability to automation is relatively high due to the potential for automated
  navigation and control systems, but the need for human judgment and physical intervention
  in emergencies reduces this somewhat.
