explanation: Material Moving Workers, as per the Occupation Code 53-7000, primarily
  engage in tasks that require high dexterity and physical contact, such as moving,
  loading, and unloading materials. This accounts for approximately 70% of their work
  activities. About 10% of their work involves solo computer work, such as logging
  inventory or operating computerized equipment. The remaining 20% of their work involves
  group collaboration and communication, such as coordinating with team members or
  supervisors. Given the nature of their work, they have a high vulnerability to job
  displacement due to AI and automation, estimated at 85%. This is because their tasks,
  while requiring physical dexterity, do not necessarily require the nuanced judgment
  or interpersonal skills that AI currently struggles to replicate. Furthermore, the
  rise of automated vehicles and machinery could potentially replace many of their
  tasks.
